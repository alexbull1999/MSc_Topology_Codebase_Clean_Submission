SBERT Baseline Used:
baseline_features = torch.cat([
                        premise_mean,                                          # Premise representation [768]

                        premise_mean - hypothesis_mean,                        # Difference [768]
                        premise_mean * hypothesis_mean,                        # Element-wise product [768]

Hybrid Improvements:
  vs Topological: +0.019 (+2.7%)
  vs SBERT: +0.025 (+3.6%)
ðŸš€ GREAT: Hybrid approach improves over both baselines!


Note -- Look at Validation Loss in NN; overfitted -- 3,093 features is quite high-dimensional, and NNs need more data as dimensions increase, probs not enough.
